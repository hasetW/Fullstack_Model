This project is a machine learning–based breast cancer prediction system built using FastAPI for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
It predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on selected medical features.

Two machine learning models are implemented:
   Logistic Regression
   Decision Tree Classifier
Models were trained using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset(kaggle)   
Models were saved using joblib

Deployed
